I interpret user needs by starting with user stories. They make it clear what the user actually wants and why, which helps me stay focused on the real problem. It also makes it easier to break the work down into manageable steps and test each part along the way.

When I develop programs, I start by thinking about the user experience and how to meet the goals behind the feature, not just what the code needs to do. Agile helps with that because it builds in feedback, collaboration, and short, manageable timelines. I plan to keep using Agile processes like sprints, retrospectives, and daily standups to stay on track and adjust when things change. It makes development feel more human, like youâ€™re actually solving problems with people instead of just pushing out code in a vacuum.

Being a good team member means doing your part without making things harder for other people. That means communicating clearly, staying on schedule, and paying attention to what other team members need from you. The process only works when everyone stays in sync and supports each other.
